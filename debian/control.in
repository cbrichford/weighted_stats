Description: weighted-stats provides weighted statistical aggregate functions for PostgreSQL.
 It is based on the work of Ronan Dunklau and Peter Eisentraut in the weighted_mean package. 
 The weighted stats are defined as two-column aggregation functions. The first column contains
 the measure to be used. The second contains the weight of each measure.
